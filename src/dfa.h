    \brief The DFA and related logic declarations.

    The DFA is a 3 dimensional array that maps a given state and character input to a result consisting of the next state, token, and whether reading should continue.

    The DFA was created in Excel, and the excel file is available in docs/fullDFA.xlsx.
