    \brief Token functions declarations.

    The tokensMap maps a given token to a constant string, which is used by Token_GetName() to get the name of a token. The index of a token string in the tokensMap is the same as it's enumerated value. E.G, BEGIN is value 0 and "BEGIN" is at position 0 in the tokensMap array. 

    This file also contains declarations for TokenCatch methods, which are no longer used. In an earlier version of the program, a TokenCatch wrapped a given token with related data and was memory-allocated. The current version does not use TokenCatch, but it is retained here in case we need it for future parsing features.
