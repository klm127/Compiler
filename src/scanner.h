    \brief Scanner struct and 'method'

    We achieve scanning using a singleton struct called scanner of type TScanner that operates on its members using 'methods'. Every scanner method (every function in this file) begins with 'Scanner_' to indicate that it will be mutating the scanner singleton. 

    Scanner reads from the input file one line at a time. That is, it reads a line until it hits either a newline or EOF. This line is read into an expanding malloced buffer to allow for excessively large line sizes, though it prefers line sizes under 100 characters. 

    The scanner methods call the generic functions in scanner_util to read its buffer.

    The scanner is responsible for reading an input file and extracting tokens. See tokens.h / tokens.c for more information.
